# Sprint 2 Retrospective

## What have we successfully improved since the last retrospecive:

- [x] Try be on topic in meetings

- [x] Finding/making (relevant) tasks instead of delegating. Be more flexible and cross functional - dont give specific hardset roles

- [x] Database issues and testing - we should all get WAMP/MAMP

- [x] Make our Github repository cleaner - filenames standard (ground rules/ work agreement), organise software code files

- [x] Code versions - When someone refactors code they should test it works or tell everyone what they've changed

- [x] Make code reviews and refactoring more concrete


## What went well:

-Split up tasks better and relied on delegating less

-Pair programmed better, with more direction instead of the navigator only watching

-We trusted eachother to get the work done to a high standard


## What to improve for the next sprint - Solution:

-Still stay on topic more in the meetings

-We made some features that were not specifically asked for - make sure that the features that we are adding are specifically requested by the client

-Work on prioritising the features over other things like making it look good

-Code reviewing more often

-Better use of Git, with pull requests that are commented on by others

-Testing as we went along instead of waiting until the end
