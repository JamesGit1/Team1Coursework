Every user case story has been commented (with checkboxes) our Definition of Done (as suggested by Mike from Sprint 1). 
This includes a checkbox about code reviewing and so each user story, and so you can see if code reviewing has been performed for each user story.

After each pull request, someone is appointed to look over the new code. This helps us become cross-functional as we can see and explore different code within the 
project. This form of code review also allows us toreview and comment on the code we've potentially refactored.
