# Test Driven Development

- We worked incredibly closely with Test-driven development. We made unit test cases and tested our code agaisnt them so that we didn't make unnecessary code that would be ineffecient and make our project more costly to maintain. 

- By providing the minimum amount of code to pass the unit case tests, we worked closely to the user stories, brief and feedback.

- A log of our unit test cases can be found on the below excel spreadsheet:
