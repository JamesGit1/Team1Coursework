# Sprint Retrospective

## What went well
Everything generally
Pair programming - team working
SM
We get along well - cohesive dynamic 

## What to improve - solution
-Try be on topic in meetings

-Finding/making (relevant) tasks instead of delegating. Be more flexible and cross functional - dont give specific hardset roles

-Database issues and testing - we should all get WAMP/MAMP

-Make our Github repository cleaner - filenames standard (ground rules/ work agreement), organise software code files

-Code versions - When someone refactors code they should test it works or tell everyone what they've changed

-Make code reviews and refactoring more concrete

-Breaking down features into smaller parts that we can work on in pairs or individually and then implement together at a later stage.
