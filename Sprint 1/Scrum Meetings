We went through SCRUM requirements for the coursework (such as the video recording).

We updated the 'Sprint 1 Backlog: To do / In Progress / Completed' project in the GitHub repository to reflect that we had chosen user stories #1 and #2, 
by moving these to the 'In Progress' column.
We then acknowledged any potential blockages.

## Day 2 - Scrum Meeting summary
The Scrum Master for this meeting was Joshua Bradley

### Members Present:
Josh, James S, James R, Luke, Harry, Jesse, Alan

### Members Not Present:


### Summary of Conversation:
We first talked about how during the previous afternoon, the team was bottlenecked and struggled to work simultaneously. 
To combat this, we decided tasks should not be split into such small jobs, and we also looked for other user stories to work on from the Sprint 1 Backlog - deciding 
on #4, #17, and #18.
Then we talked about our plans for the day in a stand-up setting, where everyone had a chance to speak.
We updated the 'Sprint 1 Backlog: To do / In Progress / Completed' project in the GitHub repository, to show #4, #17, and #18 to be in progress. 
These tasks were assigned to Alan, James R and Harry.
We then acknowledged any potential blockages. A major one that we found yesterday morning was a limited wireframe software development application. 
Josh, being the scrum master, was tasked to find a better alternative - soon finding a free 'professional/educational' version of the same application 
which was not limited and free for students.
